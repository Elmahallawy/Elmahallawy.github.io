His academic focus includes <strong>Machine Learning, Federated Learning, Cybersecurity, and Cryptography</strong>, with the aim of developing trustworthy AI for a wide range of applications, including satellite communication, underground mining, medical applications, and the Internet of Things. During his M.Sc. under the supervision of <a href="https://www.imd.uni-rostock.de/team/mitarbeitende/persoenliche-seiten/christian-haubelt/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof.Dr-Ing. Christian Haubelt</a> and his Ph.D. journey under the guidance of <a href="https://tluocs.github.io/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Dr. Tony T. Luo</a>, Mohamed gained valuable experience by working at several international institutions, including Rostock University in Germany, Tennessee Technological University, and Missouri University of Science and Technology in the USA. He has published over 10 papers in leading journals (e.g., <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10438925" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">JSAC</a>, <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10438925" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">IEEE IoT</a>) and conferences (e.g., <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10494442" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PerCom</a>, <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10214895" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">MDM</a>, <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10021101" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Big Data</a>, <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10436841" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">GlobeCom</a>, <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10279316" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">ICC</a>). Notably, his recent paper presented at the IEEE PerCom conference was awarded with the Best Paper Runner-up Award.</p> <p class="justified-text">His innovative work on devevloping secure and trustworking AI in many applications has garnered significant attention, resulting in many interanational talks. In addition to his research contributions, Mohamed actively participates in the academic community by serving as a reviewer for several journals, including JSAC, TMC, TSUSC, TII, and EAAI.</p> <hr> <h2 id="research-interest"><span style="font-size: 24px;">Research Interest</span></h2> <p>Cutting-edge Research in Ensuring the Security and Trustworthy of Artificial Intelligence and Internet of Things, encompassing:</p> <li> Advanced Machine/Federated Learning Techniques</li> <li>Robust Cybersecurity Measures and Encryption</li> <li>Integration and Optimization of Internet of Things</li> <hr> <p><span style="font-size: 24px;">For Perspective Students</span></p> <p class="justified-text"><strong><span style="color: red;font-size: 20px;">[We are hiring!]</span></strong> My lab is currently seeking highly <strong><span style="color: red;">self motivated Ph.D. students</span></strong> to join our team.
